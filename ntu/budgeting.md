## 1. Event Overview

**NTU x WirForce** is Southeast Asia's first campus-scale gaming festival, bringing the renowned Taiwanese WirForce LAN party format to Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

**Key concept:** BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer) — attendees bring their own gaming rigs, meaning $0 hardware investment from the organiser. At 10K scale, gamers bring an estimated $2M+ worth of equipment.

**What makes this unique:**
- First WirForce outside Taiwan
- Full campus takeover — not just a LAN party, but a multi-day festival
- NTU provides venues at no cost (auditoriums, lecture halls, green spaces)
- Existing campus infrastructure (power, Wi-Fi backbone, security) reduces costs
- Student volunteer programme offsets staffing

**Festival pillars:**
1. LAN Arena — the BYOC heart of the event
2. Esports — competitive tournaments with professional broadcast
3. Campus Programming — cosplay, LED Campfire, anisong, Showcase City, Screenverse
4. Overdex — smart wristband platform for entry, quests, and (at scale) cashless payments

---

## 2. Budget Philosophy

- **Modular, not monolithic** — 3 core costs (always on) + 8 toggleable features
- **Three clear tiers** — "The Launch" (5K), "Standard" (7.5K), and "Full Scale" (10K)
- **Optimized for NTU** — leverage free venues, existing infrastructure, student volunteers
- **Revenue-offset mindset** — budgets designed to be 55–80% recoverable through sponsorship, tickets, exhibitors, and F&B

**Scaling from baseline:**
The Alpha Launch deck budgeted $300K for 2,000 BYOC gamers (infrastructure-only). These new budgets cover the **full festival** and scale as follows:
- Infrastructure: high fixed costs → scales sub-linearly
- Broadcast: mostly fixed (same stream for 2K or 10K)
- Programming/talent: scales with scope, not headcount
- Security & ops: scales roughly linearly
- Marketing: scales with ambition

- "The BYOC model is our superpower: gamers bring $2M+ worth of equipment. We invest in infrastructure and experience, not hardware."
- "NTU is not just a venue — it's a partner. Free spaces, existing infrastructure, and student volunteers cut our baseline costs by an estimated 40%."
- "All three tiers are designed to be 55–80% offset by sponsorship, tickets, and exhibitor revenue. The net investment for The Launch could be as low as $120K."
- "This isn't a one-off event — it's the foundation for an annual fixture on Singapore's cultural calendar."
