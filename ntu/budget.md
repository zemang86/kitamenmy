## Why These Numbers Work

**NTU cost advantages:**
- Venues provided by NTU — no rental fees (auditoriums, lecture halls, green spaces)
- BYOC model = $0 hardware investment (gamers bring $2M+ worth of rigs at 10K scale)
- Existing campus power, Wi-Fi backbone, and security infrastructure
- Student volunteer programme reduces staffing costs by 30–40%

**Scaling from the $300K baseline:**
- Infrastructure has high fixed costs (power, networking, Overdex dev) — scales sub-linearly
- Broadcast is mostly fixed — same stream whether 2K or 10K on-site
- Programming/talent scales with scope, not strictly headcount
- Security & ops scales roughly linearly with attendees
- Marketing scales with ambition — larger audience = broader campaign
